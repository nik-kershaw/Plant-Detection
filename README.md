#Plant-Detection#

This project is meant to detect plants in order to remove weeds, the code will use an attached webcam and in give you a window to watch what the camera seeing. Upon pressing the Q key you will send the last frame to be detected by the model. 

Model uses the Mask-RCNN algorithm (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) in order to detect the plants. All the steps to train the model are the same as the Balloon Detection portion of the Mask_RCNN project.
